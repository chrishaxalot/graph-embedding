Sphinx Philosophy
-----------------

`Sphinx`_ is what is called a documentation generator.
This means that it takes a bunch of source files in plain text,
and generates a bunch of other awesome things, mainly HTML.
For our use case you can think of it as a program that takes in plain text
files in `reStructuredText`_ format, and outputs HTML.
